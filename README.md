# Compressive-Sensing-for-Microwave-Imaging
This package contains Matlab code and GUI for Microwave Imaging using the Compressive Sensing Method

All work was done in the Dept. of ECE, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, 65409. 

The Matlab code and GUI were developed by Zengli Yang, June 2011-May 2014.
The C programs in subdirectory “util” was developed by Toby Case in 2011 and is copyright protected under software package SAIL.  
The user Instruction was written by Xiahan Yang Nov 2014.
